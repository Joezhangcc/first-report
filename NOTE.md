# note: 

about Git
1. if working as an internet product manager, I could use Github to cooperate with my team members.
2. during the process of wirting my PMA, I could use Github to record my thoughts.
3. I could fork and create other version so that I could update my file without change my orginal file.

about PMA:
1. use html to build up the web interactive hub.
2. use CSS to make the web more bueatiful and highly interactive.

about html:
1. click the three dots in the top right corner >> More Tools >> Publisher Tools >> then could view the change source code
   or
2. right click / Crtl+U >> View web source code >> then could view the change source code
3. use html to build home page and different pages
